# ML_STATISTICAL_MEASURES
Real estate price analysis with outlier detection, correlation analysis, and data visualization.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real estate prices in Bangalore using a dataset that includes information about property prices, sizes, and other features. The goal is to understand the relationships between various property attributes and their prices through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques.

## Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

  * Handle missing values and ensure the dataset is clean for further analysis.
  * Detect and handle outliers using multiple techniques like Z-score, IQR, and Percentile methods.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  * Analyze the distribution and trends of various numerical features such as price_per_sqft, total_sqft, price, and bhk.
  * Visualize the data using box plots, histograms, and scatter plots to better understand the data's characteristics.
    
3. Outlier Detection & Removal:

  * Use statistical methods such as Mean & Standard Deviation, Percentile, IQR, and Z-score to identify and remove outliers from the dataset, improving the quality of analysis.
    
4. Correlation Analysis:

  * Calculate the correlation between numerical variables and visualize the relationships using heatmaps.

5. Data Visualization:

  * Use visualizations like heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms to highlight key patterns and insights in the data.
